# Immediate Remaining Capacity Estimation of Second-Life Batteries

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper:

**"Immediate remaining capacity estimation of heterogeneous second-life lithium-ion batteries via deep generative transfer learning"**

## üöÄ Motivation

The reuse of second-life lithium-ion batteries offers substantial sustainability and economic benefits, especially in regions with weak grid infrastructure. However, challenges arise due to:

- Lack of historical usage data.
- Heterogeneity across battery formats and degradation pathways.

This project proposes a **deep generative transfer learning** framework to:
- Generate synthetic pulse test voltage data across State-of-Charge (SOC) levels using a **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**.
- Predict SOC from voltage response via an **SOC net**.
- Estimate Relative Remaining Capacity (RRC) using a **regression net**.
- Perform cross-domain adaptation with **Deep CORAL** to generalize across battery formats.

## üß† Model Architecture

The core architecture includes:
1. **VAE net**: Generates voltage response features across SOC levels.
2. **SOC net**: Predicts SOC based on voltage features.
3. **Regression net**: Estimates RRC from voltage and SOC inputs.
4. **CORAL net**: Performs domain adaptation across different battery types and degradation behaviors.
